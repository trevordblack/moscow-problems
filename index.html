                                   **The Moscow Blackball Math Questions**
                                    ***For Jews and Other Undesirables***

Introduction
====================================================================================================

This is a deeply personal quest.

There are a collection of math problems that came out of the Moscow State University math
department. Translated from the Russian, these problems were referred to as "coffin" questions,
they've also been called "killer" questions. For as much as we need to believe that mathematics and
science holds no place for politics and discrimination, that these pursuits are of a higher 
ideal, that they _must_ be untainted by the ugliest of humanity. Ugliness can be found in many
places.

Entrance to the mathematics department at the Moscow State University required a passing grade on an
entrance exam. The point of these coffion questions was, simply put, to sideline and disqualify
jewish people and other undesirables from receiving a passing grade on their exam.

Come exam time, these students would receive a different set of questions, a _harder_ set of
questions. At the International Math Olympiad Tanya Khovanova and her compatriots attempted a
collection of these problems so that they could be disseminated to the students that were going to
need them. The coffins were constructed to have elementary solutions once a "trick" was found, so
that a student could be _justifiably_ disqualified once the simplicity of the question was revealed.
These questions are fiendishly difficult, indeed many of the coffins did not even have an
trick to be discovered, they were merely impossible conceptions.

Dr. Khovanova later collated as many as she could and published them, you can find the original
paper on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.1556.pdf). I've included an attached copy at
[OriginalPaper](OriginalPaper.pdf).

My intent is to solve as many of these as I can, with as little help as I can.

Every question has a problem, the elementary IDEA, and then a solution.

As someone that has never felt _good_ enough at math, or as _smart_ as their peers, and as someone
of Russian Jewish heritage, and who is a Jew themselves,

This is a deeply personal quest.
