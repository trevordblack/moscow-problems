                                   **The Moscow Blackball Math Questions**
                                    ***For Jews and Other Undesirables***

Introduction
====================================================================================================

This is a deeply personal quest.

There are a collection of math problems that came out of the Moscow State University math
department. Translated from the Russian, these problems were referred to as "coffin" questions,
they've also been called "killer" questions. For as much as we need to believe that mathematics and
science holds no place for politics and discrimination, that these pursuits are of a higher 
ideal, that they _must_ be untainted by the ugliest of humanity. Ugliness can be found in many
places.

Entrance to the mathematics department at the Moscow State University required a passing grade on an
entrance exam. The point of these coffion questions was, simply put, to sideline and disqualify
jewish people and other undesirables from receiving a passing grade on their exam.

Come exam time, these students would receive a different set of questions, a _harder_ set of
questions. At the International Math Olympiad Tanya Khovanova and her compatriots attempted a
collection of these problems so that they could be disseminated to the students that were going to
need them. The coffins were constructed to have elementary solutions once a "trick" was found, so
that a student could be _justifiably_ disqualified once the simplicity of the question was revealed.
These questions are fiendishly difficult, indeed many of the coffins did not even have an
trick to be discovered, they were merely impossible conceptions.

Dr. Khovanova later collated as many as she could and published them, you can find the original
paper on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.1556.pdf). I've included an attached copy at
[OriginalPaper](OriginalPaper.pdf).

My intent is to solve as many of these as I can, with as little help as I can.

Every question has a problem, the elementary IDEA, and then a solution.

As someone that has never felt _good_ enough at math, or as _smart_ as their peers, and as someone
of Russian Jewish heritage, and who is a Jew themselves,

This is a deeply personal quest.


Problems
====================================================================================================

Problem 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solve the following inequality for positive $x$:

    $$ x(8 \sqrt{1-x} + \sqrt{1+x}) \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} - 16 \sqrt{1-x} $$


My Attempts
====================================================================================================

Attempt Problem 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The immediate thing that jumps out to me is the $ \sqrt{1-x} $.

In the event that $ x > 1 $ then the problem becomes a question of comparing two complex values:

    $$ x(8 i \sqrt{x-1} + \sqrt{1+x}) \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} - 16 i \sqrt{x-1} $$

It wasn't clear to me how the comparison operator works between two complex numbers, a quick
internert query created the following result:

[Can a complex number ever be considered ...](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1116022/can-a-complex-number-ever-be-considered-bigger-or-smaller-than-a-real-number)

Where the top result suggests that there are many ways to compare complex numbers, but it is
suggested to stick to something convenient, they suggest three possible ways:
1. Only compare the reals, ignore the imagination components
2. Compare the reals first, only compare imaginaries if they are equal
3. Compare the modulus of the two values

If we split the equation up:

Reals:

    $$ x \sqrt{1+x} \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} $$

Imaginaries:

    $$ 8x \sqrt{x-1}  \leq -16 \sqrt{x-1} $$

Looking strictly at the imaginaries, we can see that the inequality does not hold. $ 8 \sqrt{x-1} $
is always larger than $ -16 \sqrt{x-1} $. If we are comparing with the second option above, then the
comparison fails whenever the reals are equal:

    $$ x \sqrt{1+x} = 11 \sqrt{1+x} $$

Multiply both sides by $ \sqrt{1-x} $:

    $$ x \sqrt{1+x} \sqrt{1+x} = 11 \sqrt{1+x} \sqrt{1+x} $$
    $$ x (1+x) = 11 (1+x) $$
    $$ x + x^2 = 11 + 11x $$
    $$ x^2 - 10x - 11 = 0 $$

Quadratic Equation:

    $$ \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 + 44}}{2} $$
    $$ \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{144}}{2} $$
    $$ \frac{10 \pm 12}{2} $$
    $$ x = 11, -1$$

But we only care about values of $ x > 1 $, so we'll throw out $ x = -1 $. Returning to our original
idea, we have a value of $x$ for which the Reals are equal, forcing the comparison to switch to
imaginaries, where the comparison fails. If we inspect the reals again, we can see a trivial result
pop out:

The comparison: 

    $$ x \sqrt{1+x} \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} $$

Only holds for values of $ x \leq 11 $. We already know that $ x = 11 $ defaults to imaginary
components, so if we compare two complex numbers using the first or second option above then we have
a partial result:

    $$ 1 < x < 11 $$

We still don't have an answer if we choose option three. And we still don't have an answer for
$ 0 < x < 1 $, which are the values of x for which both sides are fully real valued.

Let's work on the modulus option now, the modulus of a complex number $ a + bi $ is found with
$ m = a^2 + b^2 $. We can rewrite our inequality in a more convenient manner:

    $$ x(8 i \sqrt{x-1} + \sqrt{1+x}) \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} - 16 i \sqrt{x-1} $$
    $$ (x\sqrt{1+x}) + (8x\sqrt{x-1})i \leq (11\sqrt{1+x}) + (-16\sqrt{x-1})i $$
    $$ C_0 \leq C_1 $$

We can solve for their moduli:

    $$ |C_0| = (x^3 + x^2) + (64x^3 - 64x^2) = 65x^3 - 63x^2 $$
    $$ |C_1| = (121x^3 + 121x^2) + (256x^3 - 256x^2) = 377x^3 - 135x^2 $$

The comparison:

	$$ 65x^3 - 63x^2 \leq 377x^3 - 135x^2 $$

We can simplify by moving terms around:

	$$ 0 \leq 312x^3 - 72x^2 $$
	$$ 0 \leq x^2(312x - 72) $$

This equality always holds for values of x greater than 1.

With this solution, we have a complete answer for values of x greater than 1. Where across our
three possible ways:
1. Reals only: 1 < x < 11
2. Reals, then Imaginaries: 1 < x < 11
3. Modulus: 1 < x

We need to now finish up the inequality for $ 0 < x \leq 1 $:

    $$ x(8 \sqrt{1-x} + \sqrt{1+x}) \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} - 16 \sqrt{1-x} $$
