Problem
====================================================================================================

Solve the following inequality for positive $x$:

    $$ x(8 \sqrt{1-x} + \sqrt{1+x}) \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} - 16 \sqrt{1-x} $$


My Attempt
====================================================================================================

The immediate thing that jumps out to me is the $ \sqrt{1-x} $.

In the event that $ x > 1 $ then the problem becomes a question of comparing two complex values:

    $$ x(8 i \sqrt{x-1} + \sqrt{1+x}) \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} - 16 i \sqrt{x-1} $$

It wasn't clear to me how the comparison operator works between two complex numbers, a quick
internet query created the following result:

[Can a complex number ever be considered ...](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1116022/can-a-complex-number-ever-be-considered-bigger-or-smaller-than-a-real-number)

Where the top result suggests that there are many ways to compare complex numbers, but it is
suggested to stick to something convenient, they suggest three possible ways:
1. Only compare the reals, ignore the imagination components
2. Compare the reals first, only compare imaginaries if they are equal
3. Compare the modulus of the two values

If we split the equation up:

Reals:

    $$ x \sqrt{1+x} \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} $$

Imaginaries:

    $$ 8x \sqrt{x-1}  \leq -16 \sqrt{x-1} $$

Looking strictly at the imaginaries, we can see that the inequality does not hold. $ 8 \sqrt{x-1} $
is always larger than $ -16 \sqrt{x-1} $. If we are comparing with the second option above, then the
comparison fails whenever the reals are equal:

    $$ x \sqrt{1+x} = 11 \sqrt{1+x} $$

Multiply both sides by $ \sqrt{1-x} $:

    $$ x \sqrt{1+x} \sqrt{1+x} = 11 \sqrt{1+x} \sqrt{1+x} $$
    $$ x (1+x) = 11 (1+x) $$
    $$ x + x^2 = 11 + 11x $$
    $$ x^2 - 10x - 11 = 0 $$

Quadratic Equation:

    $$ \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 + 44}}{2} $$
    $$ \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{144}}{2} $$
    $$ \frac{10 \pm 12}{2} $$
    $$ x = 11, -1$$

But we only care about values of $ x > 1 $, so we'll throw out $ x = -1 $. Returning to our original
idea, we have a value of $x$ for which the Reals are equal, forcing the comparison to switch to
imaginaries, where the comparison fails. If we inspect the reals again, we can see a trivial result
pop out:

The comparison: 

    $$ x \sqrt{1+x} \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} $$

Only holds for values of $ x \leq 11 $. We already know that $ x = 11 $ defaults to imaginary
components, so if we compare two complex numbers using the first or second option above then we have
a partial result:

    $$ 1 < x < 11 $$

We still don't have an answer if we choose option three. And we still don't have an answer for
$ 0 < x < 1 $, which are the values of x for which both sides are fully real valued.

Let's work on the modulus option now, the modulus of a complex number $ a + bi $ is found with
$ m = a^2 + b^2 $. We can rewrite our inequality in a more convenient manner:

    $$ x(8 i \sqrt{x-1} + \sqrt{1+x}) \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} - 16 i \sqrt{x-1} $$
    $$ (x\sqrt{1+x}) + (8x\sqrt{x-1})i \leq (11\sqrt{1+x}) + (-16\sqrt{x-1})i $$
    $$ C_0 \leq C_1 $$

We can solve for their moduli:

    $$ |C_0| = (x^3 + x^2) + (64x^3 - 64x^2) = 65x^3 - 63x^2 $$
    $$ |C_1| = (121x^3 + 121x^2) + (256x^3 - 256x^2) = 377x^3 - 135x^2 $$

The comparison:

	$$ 65x^3 - 63x^2 \leq 377x^3 - 135x^2 $$

We can simplify by moving terms around:

	$$ 0 \leq 312x^3 - 72x^2 $$
	$$ 0 \leq x^2(312x - 72) $$

This equality always holds for values of $x$ greater than 1.

With this solution, we have a complete answer for values of $x$ greater than 1. Where across our
three possible ways:
1. Reals only: $1 < x < 11 $
2. Reals, then Imaginaries: $1 < x < 11$
3. Modulus: $1 < x$

We need to now finish up the inequality for $ 0 < x \leq 1 $:

    $$ x(8 \sqrt{1-x} + \sqrt{1+x}) \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} - 16 \sqrt{1-x} $$

It's not immediately obvious to me how this equation is solved. One thing that I can quickly do to
gain an understanding of problem is solve the inequality at the extremes. Which in this case are $x$
very close to 0, and $x$ = 1

    $$ x \approx 0 $$

Approximates to

    $$ x(8 \sqrt{1-0} + \sqrt{1+x0}) \leq 11 \sqrt{1+0} - 16 \sqrt{1-0} $$
    $$ 0(8*1 + 1) \leq  11*1 - 16$$
    $$ 0 \leq -5 $$

The above inequality is false, So, our initial inequality fails in the area surrounding 0.
If we try the other extreme:

    $$ x = 1 $$

Reduces to

    $$ x(8 \sqrt{1-1} + \sqrt{1+1}) \leq 11 \sqrt{1+1} - 16 \sqrt{1-1} $$
    $$ 1(8*0 + \sqrt{2}) \leq 11 \sqrt{2} - 16*0 $$
    $$ \sqrt{2}) \leq 11 \sqrt{2} $$

Thankfully, our inequality holds at $x = 1$, so we do not have a contradiction with our earlier
work.

It's now time to actually attempt to solve the above inequality using good old fashioned algebra.
To my mind, it makes sense to group like terms of square roots, and attempt to drop them out using
linear combinations, that looks something like this:

    $$ x(8 \sqrt{1-x} + \sqrt{1+x}) \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} - 16 \sqrt{1-x} $$
    $$ 8x\sqrt{1-x} + x\sqrt{1+x} \leq - 16 \sqrt{1-x} + 11 \sqrt{1+x}  $$
    $$ 8x\sqrt{1-x} + x\sqrt{1+x} + (16\sqrt{1-x} - 11\sqrt{1+x}) 
       \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} - 16 \sqrt{1-x} + (16\sqrt{1-x} - 11\sqrt{1+x}) $$
    $$ (8x + 16)\sqrt{1-x} + (x- 11)\sqrt{1+x} \leq 0 $$

We split this equation up into two copies, then multiply each by a different square root:

    $$ \sqrt{1-x} ((8x + 16)\sqrt{1-x} + (x - 11)\sqrt{1+x}) \leq 0 $$
    $$ \sqrt{1+x} ((8x + 16)\sqrt{1-x} + (x - 11)\sqrt{1+x}) \leq 0 $$

Creating:

    $$ (8x + 16)(1-x) + (x - 11)\sqrt{1-x^2} \leq 0 $$
    $$ (8x + 16)\sqrt{1-x^2} + (x - 11)(1+x) \leq 0 $$

We repeat the pattern above:

    $$ (8x + 16) ((8x + 16)(1-x) + (x - 11)\sqrt{1-x^2}) \leq 0 $$
    $$ (x - 11) ((8x + 16)\sqrt{1-x^2} + (x - 11)(1+x)) \leq 0 $$

Creating:

    $$ (8x + 16)^2(1-x) + (8x + 16)(x - 11)\sqrt{1-x^2} \leq 0 $$
    $$ (8x + 16)(x - 11)\sqrt{1-x^2} + (x - 11)^2(1+x) \leq 0 $$

If you squint, you can see that these equations can be combined in a way that simplifies the whole
lot. Here, let me restructure the equations a little...

    $$ (8x + 16)(x - 11)\sqrt{1-x^2} + (8x + 16)^2(1-x) \leq 0 $$
    $$ (8x + 16)(x - 11)\sqrt{1-x^2} + (x - 11)^2(1+x) \leq 0 $$

We can subtract the first from the second, and we get a relatively compact equation:

    $$ (8x + 16)^2(1-x) - (x - 11)^2(1+x) \leq 0 $$

And this is where things get very messy.

    $$ 64(x^2 + 4x + 4)(1-x) - (x - 22x + 121)(1+x) \leq 0 $$
    $$ 64(-x^3 - 4x^2 -4x + x^2 + 4x + 4) -
        (x^3 -22x^2 + 121x + x^2 -22x + 121) \leq 0 $$
    $$ -65x^3 - 171x^2 - 99x + 135 \leq 0 $$
    $$ 65x^3 + 171x^2 + 99x - 135 \leq 0 $$

And this is where I have to admit that I do not know how to solve for this equation. I ended up
using a symbolic math solver, python's to be specific, but I got the result of $x = \frac{3}{5}$.

The inequality is continuous over the interval $ 0 < x \leq 1 $, and we know the inequality fails at
0, but holds at 1. This means that with our zero crossing at $x = \frac{3}{5}, the inequality must
hold over the inequality $\frac{3}{5} \leq x leq 1$

Combining our two halfs of work, we come to our ultimate solution:

1. Reals only: $ \frac{3}{5} \leq x < 11 $
2. Reals, then Imaginaries: $ \frac{3}{5} \leq x < 11 $
3. Modulus: $ \frac{3}{5} \leq x $



The Idea
====================================================================================================

Substitute

     $$  y = \frac{\sqrt{1-x}}{\sqrt{1+x}} $$

Comments on The Idea
====================================================================================================

Very interesting. Very interesting indeed.

In my intial notes, I attempted to solve for the left side of he inequality.
I noted that the right hand side of the inequality:

    $$ x(8\sqrt{1-x} + \sqrt{1+x}) $$

cannot ever be negative, i.e.:

    $$ x(8\sqrt{1-x} + \sqrt{1+x})  > 0 $$

Noting this, I attempted to solve for the inequality:

    $$ 0 \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} - 16 \sqrt{1-x} $$ 

I believed that solving for this inequality might lend me some understanding on how to solve the
problem. It made the cutting room floor because I didn't believe it ultimately helped explain the
process to solve the problem, but once reduced, this happens:

    $$ 0 \leq 11 \sqrt{1+x} - 16 \sqrt{1-x} $$ 
    $$ 0 \leq \frac{11 \sqrt{1+x} - 16 \sqrt{1-x}}{11 \sqrt{1+x}} $$ 
    $$ 0 \leq 1 - \frac{16 \sqrt{1-x} } {11 \sqrt{1+x} } $$ 

It's important to stop here for a minute to specify that it's very important that it is $\sqrt{1+x}$
in the denominator, rather than $\sqrt{1-x}$. This is because if $x=1$, then $\sqrt{1-x}$ in the
denominator is a divide-by-zero which is undefined in linear algebra. Allowing a division by zero,
and a negative in a square root (if we restrict ourselves to reals) can introduce all sorts of
strange and breaking errors.


But, we'll take $y$ as a variable, and work off of that, let's divide the whole thing by
$\sqrt{1+x}$


    $$ x(8y + 1) \leq 11 - 16y $$
